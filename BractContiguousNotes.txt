Bract Contiguous Notes

- Points: Need a new way of finding the hull of a group of points
	- Hullfinding works. Now, integrate hullfinding into Polygon so that:

		

fml, so many polar/cartesian conversions

Polygon

when finding out how to add a polygon to the edge:
find mouse xy
first test: is xy outside of the Lattice supergon?
second test: can a new polygon be fitted to 2 or more points  

Supergon

EDGE
PVector a, b;
boolean isExtensible

POLYGON
PVector[numSides] points <-- polar points!
PVector xyCenter;

class Polygon {
	ArrayList points;
	PVector xyCenter;		
}
